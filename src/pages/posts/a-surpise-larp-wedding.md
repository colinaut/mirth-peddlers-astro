So Colin Fahrion and I got married this Saturday in a SURPRISE LARP wedding. No one knew what was happening. We went as far as to register our friend as a minister in the Universal Life Church! It was incredible. I‚Äôve never been one who dreams of weddings, but by doing something so silly I ended up with my dream wedding!

We had weird family dynamics, totally out of control flower children, mad libs vows, readings from random books (including a section of Skinny Legs and All which starts, ‚ÄúJEZEBEL‚Äù) and last but not least the ring bearer took off his pants‚Ä¶ It was basically a giant ridiculous shit show! I was so nervous beforehand that things would go wrong, I was almost in tears! As soon as we started walking down the aisle and I saw everyone jumping and cheering in a cloud of bubbles and paper flower petals I started smiling and laughed the entire ceremony.

To get a sampling of the characters and the ridiculous goings on at our wedding check out:

I‚Äôm grateful to all my friends who are really, really good sports! I realize I‚Äôm probably setting myself up for retribution from some people but that is A-ok üôÇ

## Wedding Gifts

After our wedding, multiple people asked how they could give a gift. If you would like to give us a wedding gift, you can donate to our Honeymoon Fund thru paypal (or other means if you hate paypal).

### TA & Colin‚Äôs Honeymoon Fund!

All funds will be set aside in our Honeymoon Fund so we can go on a tropical vacation (destination TBD) at some point in 2015.

## Get your own set of Wedding, the LARP cards!

We have turned Wedding, the LARP into an actual published game! In order for it to work as a published game we created a new illustration,¬†changed a few of the characters, added cards for the betrothed, and revamped the cards so that they are degendered so you can have a straight wedding, a gay wedding, or whatever floats your boat!

You can download the [Wedding, the LARP Print & Play pdf](/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wedding-the-larp-cards-print-and-play.pdf) for FREE¬†or buy your own deck of [Wedding, The LARP cards from DriveThruCards](https://www.drivethrucards.com/product/140530/Wedding-The-LARP)!
