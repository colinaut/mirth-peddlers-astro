Looking forward for the game of [Mega Deathmatch Island](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/mega-deathmatch-island/) I'm running next week at Big Bad Con 2024! It will be a wide-con/long-con game — a multi-table game with two sessions! I'm running the game with the excellent Sharang Biswas and James Mendez Hodes!

-   First Match, Session One (3 1/2 hours): three tables playing Deathmatch Island (One Shot Mode). Each table has three competitor players, plus the production player (game master).
-   Food Break
-   Championship Game, Session Two: players change tables. The 3 survivors of the first match are together in a Deathmatch Island Championship Game. The remaining players sort themselves into two tables to be given the option to play another game of Deathmatch Island with new competitors or a different game using the Paragon system (Agon, Odyssey Aquatica, All Quiet No Peace, etc. — game options depend on the table GM).

I know that to fit it all in we are gonna need to hit the ground running. To assist with this I created a randomizer online tool (using Svelte) for character creation and other tables from the game. I've posted online for anyone to use in their game!
