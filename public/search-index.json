Their world crumbled. Now in this wasted world, life does as it always — it struggles to hang on. The rains come rarely anymore but rabbits learned to survive the harsh reality of the desert, long before humans ruined the world. As a desert rabbit, you’ve learned to forage for scarce food mainly during dawn and dusk when the sun is muted, always keeping an ear out for hungry snakes, monitor lizards, kites, and dingos. The human survivors are an unpredictable danger as they still cling to their machines and their war, strewing chaos across the land. You once could have asked the ancestors for help — a trick rabbits learned from the bilby — but with the cataclysm came a strange terrifying Wind howling outside this world which tore apart the Dreaming.\n\nI created this Warren World playset while home sick in bed watching Watership Down and all the Mad Max movies. After many revisions, I then ran it at [Big Bad Con](https://www.bigbadcon.com/) 2016 for some wonderfully brave rabbits. It’s now ready for any and all rabbits who want to try and find a way to survive in this post-apocalyptic wasted land!\n\n## Downloads\n\nApocalypse Warren is available for download as a pay what you want PDF.

It's hard to find the right balance of player narrative agency surprise moments which are integral to a good mystery.","tags":["game design","gming"],"body":"\nCrafting a good mystery game is challenge. It's hard to find the right balance giving players narrative agency to drive the investigation, while also allowing for surprise \"ah ha! It was the butler all along!\" moments which are integral to a good mystery.\n\n## Prescribed Storyline\n\nThere is of course the classic mystery game strong prescribed storyline approach where the game master knows everything, dropping clues for players to (hopefully) find. This requires skill to subtly steer the story from start to climactic end, without massive exposition or railroading the players.\n\nKeeping the players going generally in the right narrative direction can be hard. Clues can be missed due to failed perception checks or player characters with other agendas. Also players have a habit of running off following *emergent red herrings* based on random things that were not intended to be clues at all.\n\n## Collaborative Storytelling\n\nSome games ignore these issues by using *play to see what happens* to it's fullest. There is no set storyline. In [Brindlewood Bay](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/410316/Brindlewood-Bay-Kickstarter-Edition), each mystery involves \"a cast of Suspects, and a list of Clues, but none of it is set in stone.\" In [Lovecraftesque](https://blackarmada.com/lovecraftesque/), a gm-less game, players contribute clues to surprise each other.\n\nThis collaborative storytelling approach can be delightful, watching the story pull itself together as if by magic. It requires evocative story prompts, an encouraging facilitator, and a group of players willing to help drive to the overall story — not just their character's actions.\n\nWhile I love fully collaborative games, I also like running games with an intriguing story for players to discover. There is a joy of deducing the mystery yourselves as a player along with your character.\n\n## My Hybrid Solution to Running an Emergent Mystery\n\nI've designed my own hybrid approach: I set up the mystery where I myself don't know all the answers. During play, I use the player characters actions as brainstorming fodder to fill in the gaps. I strive to always stay one step ahead of the players, as we all race together to a satisfying climax and solution to the mystery.\n\nThis is a very improv approach which benefits with a little prep work. I plan out the mystery like a deck building game — adding the right thematic mix of elements which hopefully work together when faced with the chaos of actual play.\n\nMy prep looks like this:\n\n* Summary of the mystery and what is known thus far\n* Unanswered questions for myself about the mystery to be discovered through play\n* A list of secrets, clues, locations, and non-player characters\n* Potential complications and plot highlights, each tying together a location, secret, person, and a clue\n\nI typically list everything as bullet points but you could also use a mind map style flow chart or even create your own deck of cards to draw from. You can kick prep like this out in 15 minutes or so. However, it also can also lend itself to more involved prep especially if you create pre-gen characters tangled up with the secrets and suspects. I had a lot of fun prepping my recent bank heist Lacuna game this way — using it as an excuse to watch some bank heist films for ideas.\n\nWith my prep, everything is in superposition, clues can have multiple meanings, and branching paths lead in different directions. I allow myself the flexibility to use any of material as is, remix it, or discard it in favor of some new idea inspired by the players.\n\nBecause the resulting story hinges so much on what the players bring to the table, I can run the same mystery with different players and it will result in a different ending every time.\n\n## Credit were credit is due\n\nMuch of this style is inspired by other low prep games like Apocalypse World and Blades in the Dark. The closest however is Agon. While I first outlined this style in my [Lacuna Dark](https://colinaut.itch.io/lacuna-dark) game back in 2017, seeing how Agon sets up islands has helped solidify my approach resulting in this blog post.\n\n---\n\n*Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jordanmcdonald?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Jordan McDonald</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/noir-mystery?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>*\n  "},{"slug":"ghost-census","category":"blog","title":"Ghost Census","description":"A business card game for tracking the ghost!","tags":["game","larp"],"body":"I created Ghost Census as a business card sized game to be passed out at [Big Bad Con](https://bigbadcon.com/) 2019.

However, it is the responsibility of the player and the game master find the right moment for the dramatic reveal, which can be difficult. Secrets are boring if they are shoved into the scene at the wrong moment and worse when they are never exposed.\n\nOpen Secrets requires players to separate their knowledge from what their character would know. However it gives power to the entire table to drive the story towards the great reveal. This may loose the sense of player surprise, but with a good group it often leads to a more dramatic story since everyone is invested in making a great scene.\n\nThere is no right answer for all games and all situations. Usually I run all my games using Open Secrets for the mere fact that I want the secrets to matter, to lead to tense amazing moments. The Apocalypse World principle states, \"Be a fan of the players' characters.\" I feel this is more than just a principle for the game master, it is also a principle for the other players. Open Secrets grants everyone at the table the power to make every character's story shine.\n\n## Mixing Open and Closed Secrets\n\nThere are, as I stated, various types of hidden knowledge. You might want to mix the two approaches depending on your game. Sometimes you want to drag a player out of the room to run a scene that the others would not be privy too. This is a great way to create suspicion and paranoia. Other times a character may have a concealed arcane item or cryptic power which everyone else is seeking. Keeping this knowledge hidden and springing it on them can be a thrilling experience.\n\n## Evidence as Closed Secrets\n\nTying in to my recent post on [Creating an Emergent Mystery](/posts/creating-an-emergent-mystery), I experimented with just such a mixed approach, in my recent dream world bank heist game of Lacuna:\n\n* **Character back stories and drives were open secrets:** At the beginning of the game everyone introduced their characters including their secrets, some of which overlapped with other characters.\n* **Evidence for the case were closed secrets:** Some characters had evidence that others did not have. It was up to the players to decide if and when their character when they would reveal their evidence.\n\nI reinforced this division by making all evidence either an image I printed out ahead of time or something written or drawn on an index card. This made evidence tangible. They could covertly show it to another player or dramatically throw it out on the table for all to see.\n\nThis worked pretty well. It was fun to watch players theatrically whip out their evidence! However it definitely benefited from the fact that I had prepared and printed out the evidence ahead of time. I created much more evidence than I needed so that I could use what I wanted and ignore the rest — thus in keeping an emergent story. I had a lot of fun creating photographic evidence using [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/#demo)*. I also benefited from the fact that my game took place in a dream world so weird AI images were perfect!\n\n![AI art of faceless man staring blankly at a wall with mail slots. A strange puppet looking spider emerges out of the slots shooting webbing at the man](/images/stable-diffusion-spider-bank.jpg)\n\n## Make Your Secrets Count!\n\nWhether you your closed or open secrets or a mixture of both its up to you. My main advice is to only used closed secrets when keeping it hidden will create a more interesting story. A closed secret should feel like it is bursting to be revealed!\n\n---\n\n*\\* **Side note on AI art:** While I feel using AI imagery for creating personal use graphics for games is fine, I am against it for anything professionally published. If you plan on publishing, you should create your own, hire someone, or use stock or public domain.*\n\n*Main photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@usinglight?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Stefan Steinbauer</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/secrets?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>*"},{"slug":"heckapoker","category":"blog","title":"HeckaPoker","description":"HeckaPoker, a game for use with the HeckaDeck!","tags":["game"],"body":"\nLast year, I jumped on the Kickstarter for the [Heckadeck](https://moreliespub.myshopify.com/products/heckadeck) by [Travis Nichols](https://iamtravisnichols.com/). I was sold by the ridiculous of it all and the simple yet wonderful illustrations. I’ve broken them out a few times but never really got to play a full game with them until yesterday. Of course with all the weird cards — like Beasts, Zeros, The Crone, and Octogons — the first question is what the heck do you play with the Heckadeck? My answer to this is Heckapoker!\n\n## How to Play Heckapoker\n\nHeckapoker is plays like normal straight poker with each player dealt a hand of five cards. All of the relatively normal cards (even of the extra suits) are act like normal poker hand cards. If you have a hand with a weird card, like Beasts, or Zeros, or the Crone, and you are the first to play such a card you get to come up with the rule for how that card works. That rule then persists throughout the rest of that game — of course these new game rules vanish as soon as the cards are put away so that each time Heckapoker is plays it is a different game.\n\nPossible examples:\n\n*   **Beasts** can fit in-between Jacks and Queens but don’t have to\n*   **Travelers** are useless straights as they work alone but they have a special power where they can be traded with any other card from another person’s hand\n*   **Arrow** cards automatically can fit between any split cards to create a straight (2,3,arrow,8,9 is a straight), if the arrow color matches as well as the other cards suits match then it can work as a straight flush.\n*   **The Crone** automatically invalidates everyone’s hand; all bets in the pool are kept until next hand sweetening the next hand’s pot.\n*   **Octagons** can transform the numbers and letters on cards by reducing them to their individual lines and reforming them. For instance, an A can become a 4 or vice versa.\n*   **Darkness** forces one other player to discard a card of your choice\n\nAs you can see, sometimes rules may interfere with people’s poker hands and thus require knowing who plays their hand first, play order is by whomever placed the last highest bid and then goes clockwise around the table.\n\n## Wagering for Words\n\nOf course while you could play for money the traditional wager when playing Heckapoker — a tradition I started as of yesterday — is to wager for words. For instance, the first player may bid “Shoe” and the next player may agree to wager the word “Shoe” and then call or see that bid and raise it with the word “Burrito”, the third player may then call or raise or fold before adding words to the pot to avoid loosing the words.\n\n*   The person who wins gets to keep using the words that were bid!\n*   The loser has to lost the words and must avoid using any words they lost for the remainder of the day!\n*   A devilish player may choose to raise with the word “Cards” or “Raise” forcing players to restrict their vocabulary or use alternate words when talking.\n*   Any words that were already bid in a game cannot be bid again in order to avoid overlap with players who already lost said word.\n*   Compound words are treated like different words as long as they have conceptually different meanings: for instance, a player who lost the word “Card” can still use the word “cardboard”\n\nOf course, a player could fold right out of the gate every time before putting their words in the pot, never risking loosing any words, thus in a sense “winning” but where is the fun in that?!\n\n## Where to get the Heckadeck\n\nI highly recommend picking up a Heckadeck. You can [buy Heckadeck online](https://moreliespub.myshopify.com/products/heckadeck) and other great comics and stuff from Travis Nichols site [More Lie Publishing](https://www.morelies.pub/).

The Bear places one album on each position. Let’s say there are 5 records A,B,C,D,E and the Bear preferred play order is clockwise in this order C>E>B>A>D (since this is a clock it continues and D>C… etc.). Now if the DJ plays C and then E it is in the right clockwise order and the Bear is happy, If the DJ plays C then D then it is in the wrong anti-clockwise reverse order and the Bear is angry and mauls them. If the DJ plays C and then either B or A then the Bear is annoyed as is out of order and the Bear growls_\n*   After the DJ gets mauled the first time, should the bear start from the original start place? _When the DJ get’s mauled they just put on another record — either one they played before or a new one. There is no “start place” for the Bear’s music order preferences as it’s a continuous circle. Let’s say the Bear’s preferences are B, A, C, E, D — then the DJ can “win” by playing in a row consecutively B, A, C, E, D or A, C, E, D, B or C, E, D, B, A or E, D, B, A, C or D, B, A, C, E. Probably better way of thinking about it is the DJ needs to make the bear happy 4 times in a row by playing albums in the right order._"},{"slug":"unstoppable-power","category":"blog","title":"Unstoppable Power!","description":"Wedding, The LARP is a 16-80 person two hour freeform live action role play of a stereotypical American wedding — full of weird family dynamics, totally out of control flower children, absent minded ring bearer, mad libs vows, readings from random books, loud mouthed old friends, and exasperated caterers.","tags":["game","rpg","playtest"],"body":"\n**UPDATE Oct 15, 2019:** Development for this game is back underway after a long hiatus!

I ran this game at Big Bad Con 2019 and it went great. I will be doing more playtesting in the coming months. If you are interested in playtesting contact me at [info@mirthpeddlers.com](mailto:info@mirthpeddlers.com)\n\n* * *\n\n**UPDATE Jan 28, 2017:** The development for this game is on hiatus. I ran a number of play test sessions and while they were fun overall the game wasn’t quite working. I have some vague ideas for how to redesign the game but it is on hold.\n\n* * *\n\nI had a inspiration the other day that superhero games are boring as they only tell the day to day banal tales of laser beam shooting out of peoples eyes. Wouldn’t it be great to tell the full story of what having real power is like? What it’s like to be heroes like Dr Manhattan with powers so beyond mere mortals that it’s hard to relate to anyone or anything?\n\nThe game Unstoppable Power is a one-shot storygame that tells the story of normal people who gain superpowers. And how this ‘gift’ of true power transforms them until they can no longer can relate to the world or people they once knew, and likely leaving irrevocable harm in their wake.\n\nThe game mechanics are pretty honed in — simple and designed to help support the story of people facing their own Unstoppable Power. I’ve run a solo play of the game to test the system and it worked great. Next step is running real playtests which is happening soon. If you are interested in play testing Unstoppable Power you can contact me at [info@mirthpeddlers.com](mailto:info@mirthpeddlers.com)\n\nHere’s a quick overview summary of the story that the game told in my solo playtest…  \n\n> The story started as Sonny, a retired hit man fighting to save his kidnapped boyfriend. He died in a massive gun battle yet then rose from death as a silent shadow enshrouded assassin — first taking revenge, then fighting crime mostly because he was bored. Time passed and he drifted away from all he once was transforming into a being known only as Operation Shadow by the US government. Project Shadow worked with the Pentagon and CIA to target ISIS — an operation that succeeded in destroying ISIS yet caused massive collateral damage and worldwide outrage. Shunned by a coalition of world governments, the world spanning essence of shadow known as Project Shadow to some and the Dark Djinn to others has the power to destroy entire nations. In fact it accidentally wiped Syria off the map — it was only trying to help! Feared and truly disconnected from the people of the world, it decides for esoteric reasons all it’s own to leave Earth. During a lunar eclipse, it steps to the moon and breaks off a piece the size of the Mount McKinley, then gets on and aims it at the black hole at the center of the Galaxy. A small shadowy part of it however stayed behind on Earth to possess — no possess isn’t the right word  — to become one with the old boyfriend (his boyfriend?) who was all but left behind so many years ago.\n\nThere was a lot more detail I left out, but yeah that’s the kind of wow story you can tell with Unstoppable Power in only a single one-shot game!\n\n[![Unstoppable-Power-v2](/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Unstoppable-Power-v2.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Unstoppable-Power-v2.png)"},{"slug":"wedding-the-larp","category":"blog","title":"Wedding, the LARP","description":"Wedding, The LARP is a 16-80 person two hour freeform live action role play of a stereotypical American wedding — full of weird family dynamics, totally out of control flower children, absent minded ring bearer, mad libs vows, readings from random books, loud mouthed old friends, and exasperated caterers.","tags":["game","larp"],"body":"\n\nWedding, The LARP is a 16-80 person two hour freeform live action role play of a stereotypical American wedding — full of weird family dynamics, totally out of control flower children, absent minded ring bearer, mad libs vows, readings from random books, loud mouthed old friends, and exasperated caterers.\n\nAll it takes to play is Wedding, the LARP is the deck of cards (80 character cards and two instruction cards), a few props, some refreshments, appetizers, and a host of friends who either wittingly or unwittingly are roped into your scheme.

Both the wedding and the game itself was a surprise to all our friends who attended — _the invitations stated it was a holiday party that they really must attend!_ No one knew what was happening. We went as far as to register our friend as a minister in the Universal Life Church! The wedding was so amazing we felt we had to share by making the game public.
