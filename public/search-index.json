No one knew what was happening. We went as far as to register our friend as a minister in the Universal Life Church! It was incredible. I’ve never been one who dreams of weddings, but by doing something so silly I ended up with my dream wedding!\n\nWe had weird family dynamics, totally out of control flower children, mad libs vows, readings from random books (including a section of Skinny Legs and All which starts, “JEZEBEL”) and last but not least the ring bearer took off his pants… It was basically a giant ridiculous shit show! I was so nervous beforehand that things would go wrong, I was almost in tears! As soon as we started walking down the aisle and I saw everyone jumping and cheering in a cloud of bubbles and paper flower petals I started smiling and laughed the entire ceremony.\n\nTo get a sampling of the characters and the ridiculous goings on at our wedding check out:\n\n*   [Photos of the wedding](https://www.facebook.com/Shalzers/media_set?set=a.723953114349690&type=3) by the excellent photographer [Shalaco](https://shalaco.com/) who traded to get the Photographer character card\n*   [More photos of the wedding](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sandwichgirl/sets/72157649609879236/) by our super friendly Greeter, SandwichGirl\n*   [Wedding, the LARP character cards (TA & Colin’s Wedding Special Edition)](/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wedding-the-larp-TA-Colin-Edition-cards-print-and-play.pdf)\n*   [TA & Colin’s wedding program and game rules](/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/program.pdf)\n*   [TA & Colin’s madlib wedding ceremony script & vows](/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Ceremony.pdf)\n\nI’m grateful to all my friends who are really, really good sports!

Their world crumbled. Now in this wasted world, life does as it always — it struggles to hang on. The rains come rarely anymore but rabbits learned to survive the harsh reality of the desert, long before humans ruined the world. As a desert rabbit, you’ve learned to forage for scarce food mainly during dawn and dusk when the sun is muted, always keeping an ear out for hungry snakes, monitor lizards, kites, and dingos. The human survivors are an unpredictable danger as they still cling to their machines and their war, strewing chaos across the land. You once could have asked the ancestors for help — a trick rabbits learned from the bilby — but with the cataclysm came a strange terrifying Wind howling outside this world which tore apart the Dreaming.\n\nI created this Warren World playset while home sick in bed watching Watership Down and all the Mad Max movies. After many revisions, I then ran it at [Big Bad Con](https://www.bigbadcon.com/) 2016 for some wonderfully brave rabbits. It’s now ready for any and all rabbits who want to try and find a way to survive in this post-apocalyptic wasted land!\n\n## Downloads\n\nApocalypse Warren is available for download as a pay what you want PDF.

I was sold by the ridiculous of it all and the simple yet wonderful illustrations. I’ve broken them out a few times but never really got to play a full game with them until yesterday. Of course with all the weird cards — like Beasts, Zeros, The Crone, and Octogons — the first question is what the heck do you play with the Heckadeck? My answer to this is Heckapoker!\n\n## How to Play Heckapoker\n\nHeckapoker is plays like normal straight poker with each player dealt a hand of five cards. All of the relatively normal cards (even of the extra suits) are act like normal poker hand cards. If you have a hand with a weird card, like Beasts, or Zeros, or the Crone, and you are the first to play such a card you get to come up with the rule for how that card works. That rule then persists throughout the rest of that game — of course these new game rules vanish as soon as the cards are put away so that each time Heckapoker is plays it is a different game.\n\nPossible examples:\n\n*   **Beasts** can fit in-between Jacks and Queens but don’t have to\n*   **Travelers** are useless straights as they work alone but they have a special power where they can be traded with any other card from another person’s hand\n*   **Arrow** cards automatically can fit between any split cards to create a straight (2,3,arrow,8,9 is a straight), if the arrow color matches as well as the other cards suits match then it can work as a straight flush.\n*   **The Crone** automatically invalidates everyone’s hand; all bets in the pool are kept until next hand sweetening the next hand’s pot.\n*   **Octagons** can transform the numbers and letters on cards by reducing them to their individual lines and reforming them. For instance, an A can become a 4 or vice versa.\n*   **Darkness** forces one other player to discard a card of your choice\n\nAs you can see, sometimes rules may interfere with people’s poker hands and thus require knowing who plays their hand first, play order is by whomever placed the last highest bid and then goes clockwise around the table.\n\n## Wagering for Words\n\nOf course while you could play for money the traditional wager when playing Heckapoker — a tradition I started as of yesterday — is to wager for words. For instance, the first player may bid “Shoe” and the next player may agree to wager the word “Shoe” and then call or see that bid and raise it with the word “Burrito”, the third player may then call or raise or fold before adding words to the pot to avoid loosing the words.\n\n*   The person who wins gets to keep using the words that were bid!\n*   The loser has to lost the words and must avoid using any words they lost for the remainder of the day!\n*   A devilish player may choose to raise with the word “Cards” or “Raise” forcing players to restrict their vocabulary or use alternate words when talking.\n*   Any words that were already bid in a game cannot be bid again in order to avoid overlap with players who already lost said word.\n*   Compound words are treated like different words as long as they have conceptually different meanings: for instance, a player who lost the word “Card” can still use the word “cardboard”\n\nOf course, a player could fold right out of the gate every time before putting their words in the pot, never risking loosing any words, thus in a sense “winning” but where is the fun in that?!\n\n## Where to get the Heckadeck\n\nI highly recommend picking up a Heckadeck. You can [buy Heckadeck online](https://moreliespub.myshopify.com/products/heckadeck) and other great comics and stuff from Travis Nichols site [More Lie Publishing](https://www.morelies.pub/). And when you do buy it you will get a special card that you must DESTROY!

The Bear places one album on each position. Let’s say there are 5 records A,B,C,D,E and the Bear preferred play order is clockwise in this order C>E>B>A>D (since this is a clock it continues and D>C… etc.). Now if the DJ plays C and then E it is in the right clockwise order and the Bear is happy, If the DJ plays C then D then it is in the wrong anti-clockwise reverse order and the Bear is angry and mauls them. If the DJ plays C and then either B or A then the Bear is annoyed as is out of order and the Bear growls_\n*   After the DJ gets mauled the first time, should the bear start from the original start place? _When the DJ get’s mauled they just put on another record — either one they played before or a new one. There is no “start place” for the Bear’s music order preferences as it’s a continuous circle. Let’s say the Bear’s preferences are B, A, C, E, D — then the DJ can “win” by playing in a row consecutively B, A, C, E, D or A, C, E, D, B or C, E, D, B, A or E, D, B, A, C or D, B, A, C, E. Probably better way of thinking about it is the DJ needs to make the bear happy 4 times in a row by playing albums in the right order._"},{"slug":"unstoppable-power","category":"blog","title":"Unstoppable Power!","description":"Wedding, The LARP is a 16-80 person two hour freeform live action role play of a stereotypical American wedding — full of weird family dynamics, totally out of control flower children, absent minded ring bearer, mad libs vows, readings from random books, loud mouthed old friends, and exasperated caterers.","tags":["game","rpg","playtest"],"body":"\n**UPDATE Oct 15, 2019:** Development for this game is back underway after a long hiatus!

Wouldn’t it be great to tell the full story of what having real power is like? What it’s like to be heroes like Dr Manhattan with powers so beyond mere mortals that it’s hard to relate to anyone or anything?\n\nThe game Unstoppable Power is a one-shot storygame that tells the story of normal people who gain superpowers. And how this ‘gift’ of true power transforms them until they can no longer can relate to the world or people they once knew, and likely leaving irrevocable harm in their wake.\n\nThe game mechanics are pretty honed in — simple and designed to help support the story of people facing their own Unstoppable Power. I’ve run a solo play of the game to test the system and it worked great. Next step is running real playtests which is happening soon. If you are interested in play testing Unstoppable Power you can contact me at [info@mirthpeddlers.com](mailto:info@mirthpeddlers.com)\n\nHere’s a quick overview summary of the story that the game told in my solo playtest…  \n\n> The story started as Sonny, a retired hit man fighting to save his kidnapped boyfriend. He died in a massive gun battle yet then rose from death as a silent shadow enshrouded assassin — first taking revenge, then fighting crime mostly because he was bored. Time passed and he drifted away from all he once was transforming into a being known only as Operation Shadow by the US government. Project Shadow worked with the Pentagon and CIA to target ISIS — an operation that succeeded in destroying ISIS yet caused massive collateral damage and worldwide outrage. Shunned by a coalition of world governments, the world spanning essence of shadow known as Project Shadow to some and the Dark Djinn to others has the power to destroy entire nations. In fact it accidentally wiped Syria off the map — it was only trying to help! Feared and truly disconnected from the people of the world, it decides for esoteric reasons all it’s own to leave Earth. During a lunar eclipse, it steps to the moon and breaks off a piece the size of the Mount McKinley, then gets on and aims it at the black hole at the center of the Galaxy. A small shadowy part of it however stayed behind on Earth to possess — no possess isn’t the right word  — to become one with the old boyfriend (his boyfriend?) who was all but left behind so many years ago.\n\nThere was a lot more detail I left out, but yeah that’s the kind of wow story you can tell with Unstoppable Power in only a single one-shot game!\n\n[![Unstoppable-Power-v2](/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Unstoppable-Power-v2.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Unstoppable-Power-v2.png)"},{"slug":"wedding-the-larp","category":"blog","title":"Wedding, the LARP","description":"Wedding, The LARP is a 16-80 person two hour freeform live action role play of a stereotypical American wedding — full of weird family dynamics, totally out of control flower children, absent minded ring bearer, mad libs vows, readings from random books, loud mouthed old friends, and exasperated caterers.","tags":["game","larp"],"body":"\n\nWedding, The LARP is a 16-80 person two hour freeform live action role play of a stereotypical American wedding — full of weird family dynamics, totally out of control flower children, absent minded ring bearer, mad libs vows, readings from random books, loud mouthed old friends, and exasperated caterers.\n\nAll it takes to play is Wedding, the LARP is the deck of cards (80 character cards and two instruction cards), a few props, some refreshments, appetizers, and a host of friends who either wittingly or unwittingly are roped into your scheme.
